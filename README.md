React Homework: Employee Directory

## Description

This is an employee directory created with React. This app's UI is broken into components and responds to user events.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
